Brian2CUDA documentation
========================

Brian2CUDA is an extension of the spiking neural network simulator `Brian2`_, which
allows flexible model definitions in Python. Brian2CUDA uses the code generation system
from Brian2 to generate simulation code in C++/CUDA, which is executed on NVIDIA
graphics processing units (GPUs).

By adding two lines of code to your Brian2 imports, you can execute your
simulations on a GPU::

   from brian2 import *
   import brian2cuda
   set_device("cuda_standalone")

.. implements a `Brian2 standalone device`_ that generates C++/CUDA code and runs
.. simulations on NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs).



ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ This documentation is currently under construction  ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

It will soon document the ins and outs of `Brian2CUDA
<https://github.com/brian-team/brian2cuda>`_ - a Brian2 extension to simulate
spiking neural networks on GPUs!
